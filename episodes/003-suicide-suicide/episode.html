<h3>Dan's Notes</h3>

<p>This record is considered very influential, providing a foundation of raw ingredients that have inspired many genres and artists. Alan Vega's haunting vocals and Martin Rev's relentless synth beats create a minimalist and intense sound, capturing the chaotic essence of urban rebellion. The album blends a punk punk energy with proto-electronic sounds.</p>

<p>Listening closely, I do hear some of the artists that they influenced.
* Beats of Fury - Chemical Brothers
* Closer - NIN
* Death Valley 69 - Sonic Youth
* Nightclubbing - Iggy Pop (the drum sound)
Henry Rollins from Black Flag has sited suicide as an influence many times.</p>

<p>However, I must admit that this album represents a very tedious listen for me. It's like consuming baker's chocolate: while I can appreciate the raw ingredients and their potential, it's not something I'd choose to enjoy on its own. I love punk and some industrial music, but I prefer the polished, finished product over the raw components. This album, much like raw cacao, is more of a historical artifact than something I'd revisit for pleasure.</p>

<p>In fact, I wouldn't recommend any individual track from this album to a friend. While I recognize its importance and influence, the songs feel more suited as backing tracks in a psychedelic film, perhaps something directed by David Lynch, rather than as stand-alone pieces of art. The atmosphere they create is compelling, but not something I'd personally enjoy outside of that context.</p>

<p>The album blends punk energy with proto-electronic sounds.</p>

<h4>Ghost Rider</h4>

<p>Alan Vega is said to have haunting vocals. They are stylized talking with a lot of reverb. He's going for a vibe for sure.
<a href="">Covered by R.E.M</a>. It's Still a tough listen, but they did a good job of finding the song's bones.</p>

<h4>Rocket USA</h4>

<p>The pulsing drum machine hurts my ears like when you have the windows rolled down in the car and you get that pulsing pressure wave.</p>

<p>There is a organ part.</p>

<p>A song about driving too fast.</p>

<h4>Cheree</h4>

<p>This song has a chord progression. So there's that. It's pretty hip too I IV V IV.
This is the first thing that resembles a song. The drum "beat" is somewhat interesting, a sixteenth-note kick pattern with a clicking ostinato. It's almost a 2-3 Clave</p>

<p>I don't mind experimental music. There's some old Pink Floyd.
* Careful with that Axe Eugene
* Set the Controls for the heart of the sun
* Several Species of small fury animals... no</p>

<h4>Johnny</h4>

<p>This is probably the most irritating 12 bar blues I’ve ever heard. As I understand it, Alan Vega was channeling his inner Elvis as an influence for his vocal performance on this one. It’s pretty rare that Allen actually sings on this album. This is probably the most actual singing that he does on the album.</p>

<p>Doors Rock organ </p>

<h4>Girl</h4>

<p>A 3-2 Clave Bossa Nova (ish)
It's a song about a pervert</p>

<h4>Frankie Teardrop</h4>

<p>State Trouper By Bruce Springsteen</p>

<h4>Che</h4>

<p>I bVII bVI V</p>

<p>More pressure wave stuff.</p>
